      <h2>Equal Pay in Football – Fairness or Fantasy?</h2>
      <p>In today’s world, the topic of equal pay in sports is everywhere. People are talking about it in locker rooms, boardrooms, group chats, and even on the floor of Congress. It’s trending on Instagram, filling headlines, and sparking debates that often get more heated than the games themselves.</p>
      <p>But when you take away all the noise, the real question is simple:</p>
      <p><strong>Should men and women be paid the same in sports, even if they bring in different amounts of money?</strong></p>
      <p>That’s the conversation we’re having here. And we’re not just picking one side—we’re laying it all out.</p>
      <p>This site was built to explore the equal pay debate from all angles. Not just how people feel about it, but what the facts, the history, and the current trends actually show. Whether you're a student, an athlete, a fan, or just someone who’s curious, this space is for you to think critically, challenge assumptions, and come to your own conclusion.</p>

      <h2>💰 The Revenue Reality</h2>
      <img class="full-width" src="girl 4.png" alt="USWNT Equal Pay Settlement">
      <p>Some athletes, economists, and fans believe that pay in sports should be determined by performance and the money you bring in not by gender. At the end of the day, they argue, sports are a business. And like any business, compensation should match contribution.</p>
      <p><strong>UFC fighter Ronda Rousey put it bluntly:</strong><br>
      “I’m the highest-paid fighter not because they wanted to do something nice for the ladies, but because I bring in the most money.”</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Men’s World Cup generated about $6 billion</li>
        <li>The Women’s World Cup brought in $131 million</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>📜 Looking at the History Behind the Pay Gap</h2>
      <img class="full-width" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/01/31/14/34/equality-2025795_1280.jpg" alt="Equal Pay Act and protest image">
      <p>But money isn’t the whole story.</p>
      <p>This part of the site explores how the gender pay gap in sports didn’t just “happen.” For a long time, women were completely shut out of sports. And when they were finally let in, they faced huge barriers like limited funding, barely any media attention, and low fan turnout. So, it’s not that women’s sports can’t bring in money, it’s that they’ve never had the same chance to.</p>
      <p>Here, we look at:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Equal Pay Act of 1963</li>
        <li>Research on systemic inequality</li>
        <li>Movements that are trying to change the game, literally</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🌍 What’s Changing and Where We’re Headed</h2>
      <img class="full-width" src="girl 7.jpeg" alt="Serena Williams Smiling">
      <p>So, how do we actually fix this?</p>
      <p>Good news, there are already signs of progress.</p>
      <p>Big deals are being made, like Netflix partnering with FIFA to stream future Women’s World Cups. Leagues like the NWSL are changing outdated systems that held women back. And new sponsorships, contracts, and broadcasting rights are starting to shift the playing field.</p>
      <p>This section highlights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Smart solutions that are already in motion</li>
        <li>Collective wins from female athletes</li>
        <li>A future where pay is more fair—not because it was forced, but because the system was rebalanced</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’re not just looking at problems—we’re spotlighting what’s working and what might work even better.</p>
